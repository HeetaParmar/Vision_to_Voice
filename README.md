# Vision_to_Voice
•	Built an object detection model using YOLOV8n for efficient and accurate object identification.
•	Employed gTTS and Pyttsx3 libraries to convert detection outputs into speech, guiding user interactions.
•	Enhanced spatial awareness by estimating the proximity of detected objects relative to the users.
